# goaqara
Implementation of the Aqara open API in a very early stage.

Before it can be used, you need to register on [Aqara's developer portal](https://developer.aqara.com) and a project has to be registered.
Both requires approval by Aqara and might take several days. Note that the time of writing, Aqara only approves projects for enterprise customers.
